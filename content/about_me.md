Hello dear visitor and welcome to my little blog! ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Domi and since I can remember, I was fascinated by technical stuff. 
As so many, I started of with playing Nintendo, moved on to the computer and was soon building them on my own.
During university, I felt in love with programming and got in touch with C, Java and finally Python, my go-to language until today.

Having worked as an IT business consultant over the last couple of years, I noticed that I'd like to integrate programming more into my daily job.
Thus, I'm planning to level up my knowledge, built a portfolio and see what will happen `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯` 

In this blog, you will find ...
- ... know-how that I find interesting to share
- ... tools that I'm using, e.g. to manage the knowledge I'm gathering or to code
- ... tips & tricks for your everyday life ðŸ˜‰

Enjoy your stay on the site,  
Domi
