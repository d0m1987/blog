## Why this article?

I was researching which static site generator (SSG) to use when I'm starting my blog.
There were a lot of possibilities, e.g. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that is [directly promoted through Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

Nevertheless, I chose Hugo. Some of the reasons for Hugo were...
- It's build on Go and this is a programming language I want to learn during this year. So I hope that this will be a good match 🤞
- I found the theme [Clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) (credits to Chip Zoller. Great work! 👍) and instantly fell in love with it. I like the features, I like the layout and best: it's actively maintained.
- The start reminded me of World of Warcraft: easy to start (< 5 minutes) and get something up and running. But nevertheless, the further you progress, your possibilities seem to be huge! 

After my start with Hugo, I was a bit struggling to find proper / the best resources to start of. Especially, if you are into modifying the templates yourself. So here you can find an ongoing article where I'll add my resources that I use to learn Hugo.
